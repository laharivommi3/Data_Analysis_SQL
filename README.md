# SQL PORTFOLIO PROJECT

# Overview:
The objective of this project is to analyze the data using basic/intermediate SQL queries with SQL(SQL SERVER). The idea of analysing the data is to get the overview of what actutally is happening in a food delivery business.It consist of 10 columns such as userid,signup_date,price,item_id etc.

Tools and Technologies: Utilized Microsoft SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT for data querying and data manipulation.

# Data Exploration:
While Exploring Data with SQL, I worked on the following things.

1.Created tables named 'users','goldusers','orders' and 'items'.

2.Inserted values into each table.

3.Merged 2 differnt tables and added the new column of userid with the help of primary key as userid column.

4.With the help of aggregate functions AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()and SUM(), I performed some queries on the data.

# SQL Queries: 
Developed SQL queries to segment customers based on purchase history, demographics, and customer behavior.
The following are the queries:
List out all the item names along with their price.

What is the most ordered item?

Find the most expensive item from items?

Find the least expensive item from items?

Find out the users who signed up in the year 2015.

What is the least ordered item?

Find the items whose cost ranges from 100 t0 500?

What is the total revenue in the year 2016?

List the ice creams along with their prices from the items table.

List all the user id's from users and goldusers tables.

What is the average cost of the items?

# Outcomes: 
This project led to data and business analysis that gives meaningful insights to the company.

# Learning Points: 
Enhanced SQL querying skills and gained experience in SQL.
